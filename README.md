# IDEAS_Internship_TMT_Price_Prediction
Overview

Built a time-series forecasting solution to predict short-term steel price movements using historical and market-linked variables. The project compared classical and deep learning models to identify the most reliable forecasting approach for real-world decision support.

What I Worked On

Cleaned and prepared industrial time-series data

Built and compared Random Forest, Prophet and LSTM models

Engineered lag features and seasonality indicators

Evaluated models using R², RMSE, MAE

Generated 7/30/60-day forecasts and trend comparisons

Key Outcome

Prophet and multivariate LSTM models showed strong performance in capturing seasonality and short-term trends, supporting practical forecasting use cases.

Tech Stack
